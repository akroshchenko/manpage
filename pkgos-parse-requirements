NAME
	
	pkgos-parse-requirements - output list of project requirements 

SYNOPSIS
	
	pkgos-parse-requirements -h

	pkgos-parse-requirements <input_file_for_parsing>  

	pkgos-parse-requirements 


DESCRIPTION

	This utility attemps to parse an OpenStack requirements.txt file
as input, and produce a list of Debian dependencies as output.

	It takes the first argument as the file to parse.

	If this utility is called without a parameter, it will attempt
to read the requirements.txt and test-requirements.txt file.

	-h - output discription

	Note that this is far from perfect, and that you *WILL* need to
manually check for the dependencies.

	*CASES OF MANUAL EDDITING*:

	Some packages should never be in the dependencies in Debian
as they are included in Python (version 2 or 3). If you find one that is
missing, just add it to the BLACK_LIST(for missing packages of
Python 2) and/or the BLACK_LIST_PY3(for missing packages of Python 3).


DEPENDENCIES

	basic linux utilities
